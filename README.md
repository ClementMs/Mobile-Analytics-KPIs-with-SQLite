# Mobile-Analytics-KPIs-with-SQLite
Optimizing monetization KPIs (such as conversion rates or daily average revenue per user) has become a major challenge to drive the success of mobile apps. In this project, I used a mobile app database to extract a few of these monetization KPIs with SQLite.
The csv files used to create the database can be found in the course "Customer Analytics & A/B Testing in Python" on DataCamp. The metrics were only calculated using Python on DataCamp. Using SQL seems more appropriate to extract such mobile analytics KPIs.
